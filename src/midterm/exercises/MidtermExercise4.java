* Activity Name and Number: Midterm Exercise Program 3A
------------------------------------------------------------
Test the program given below with different possible input values. Note that the program allows
the user to enter invalid values (0 or negative number for the quantity, 0 or negative number for
the unit price, etc.). In addition, the program allows the user to enter a cash tendered amount that
is lesser that the amount to be paid.
Required:
Write an improved version of the program that will provide validation processes for the input
values. The following should be imposed: (Filename: MidtermExercise4.java)
✓ The valid product names should be limited to only 5 product names ( e.g. “pen”, “pencil”, “short bond paper”, “long bond paper”, “pad paper”)
✓ The quantity cannot be a negative number.
✓ The unit price must be greater than zero
✓ The discount rate cannot be negative and it cannot be more than 100 percent.
✓ The amount tendered cannot be lower than the amount to be paid.
If an input value is invalid, the user should be given an appropriate error message and a directive
to enter another value. The user may repeatedly supply an invalid value. The processing should
continue only after the user enters a valid value.
